# Parameter Description

Mandatory parameters:

- target
- token

Optional parameters:

- pass
- mode
- url
- port

## target

The target can be a channel, group, or individual.

When the target is a channel, the bot needs to be added to the channel as an administrator, make the channel public, and customize the channel link. The target value should be filled with the link, such as @xxxx.

When the target is a group, the bot needs to be added to the group, make the group public, and customize the group link. The target value should be filled with the link, such as @xxxx.

When the target is an individual, it is the Telegram ID (obtained from @getmyid_bot).

## token

Fill in your bot token.

## pass

Fill in the access password. If not needed, fill in ```none``` directly.

## mode

- ```p``` represents running in cloud drive mode, with no restriction on uploaded suffixes.
- ```m``` On top of the p mode, web upload is disabled, and upload can be done via private chat (if the target is an individual, only specified users can upload via private chat).

## url

The pre-domain address that bot obtains FileID is automatically filled in.

## port

Customize the running port.

# Management

## Get FIleID

Replying with ```get``` to the file reference in the bot's chat can get the FileID. Access the resource by combining the built address and the obtained path.

If the url parameter is configured, the complete address will be returned directly.
